## Newspapers

### Local newspapers

[This website](http://www.onlinenewspapers.com/index.shtml) shows the most important newspapers per Country
### Worldwide

The BBC- a news service that is possibly one of the best in the world. Unbiased (plot twist biased) by law and extraordinarily good at getting the facts right.

Washington Post- Good investigative journalism in national politics. Pulitzer winning and has been around forever.

Associated Press- the American equivalent to the BBC. Most news companies repost their stories.

New York Times- good investigative journalism and good op-eds. Kinda National and local politics centric, but overall fairly good.
