    "maintext": "Marcelo Seluchi, a meteorologist at the government\u2019s national disaster monitoring center, said the current crisis was years in the making. Since 2014, large regions in central, southeast and western Brazil have experienced below-average rain levels.\n\u201cFor eight years, it hasn\u2019t been raining as much as it tends to rain,\u201d he said, calling the drought unusually widespread and lengthy. \u201cIt\u2019s like a water tank that doesn\u2019t get refilled, and each year we use up more and more hoping that the following year things will improve, but that better year has yet to come.\u201d\nMr. Seluchi said rain patterns that have contributed to the drought were manifold and not fully understood. They include La Ni\u00f1a, a weather pattern in the Pacific Ocean, climate change, and deforestation in the Amazon and other biomes that play a key role in precipitation cycles.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t deny that climate change, namely global warming, plays a role,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s raining less and we\u2019re using more water.\u201d\nAfter power outages in 2001, Brazil committed to building increasingly versatile power systems, diversifying its sources beyond hydroelectric plants. Since then, the country has reduced its electrical grid\u2019s reliance on hydropower to 65 percent from 90 percent.\nWhile government officials have played down the risk of power cuts, the national electricity agency recently warned that some customers could receive higher electric bills as the country is forced to rely more heavily on more expensive thermoelectric power. The agency urged Brazilians to save energy by taking short showers, using air-conditioners more sparingly and running washing machines less frequently.",
