# Meeting Notes
This Folder includes meeting notes documenting the issues and the tasks discussed in each meeting. When possible, a link to the recording of the meeting can be found.

### Creating new meeting notes

Simply make a copy of Template.md and fill the data in. Once you save the new file you just created, follow the naming convention (e.g.: 'Meeting' + {number of meeting}).

In case you want to add files that are complementary to the meeting notes seperately, please save them under /etc. Note that there is no Template.md or any styling convention in there, however try to keep them organized and navigatable.

The template was created to unify representation of the meeting notes in order to 
make it easier for the reader to get the info he needs from the meeting notes.
