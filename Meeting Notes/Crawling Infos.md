# Crawling Websites Without Getting Blocked

All tipps from: https://oxylabs.io/blog/how-to-crawl-a-website-without-getting-blocked

* Read **robot.txt** file of the target website which indicate whether it allows scrapping and their rules like number of requests.
* Avoid **rush hours** at which the amount of requests on the website relativly heavly is.
* You may use either **data center or residential proxies**. Residential proxey should have ip rotation while data center doesn't have rotation what means that it may likely be blocked. Anyway it costs about 3k a month xD
* **User agent** should be switched frequently.

* There are also **"honeybot traps"**, fingerpringt, captcha,...
