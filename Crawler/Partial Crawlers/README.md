# This <code>README.md</code> file should contain Documentation

This minicrawler crawls posts from this [MegaList](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocationReddits/wiki/index) of subreddits. 
The list contains ~450 subreddits dedicated to different geolocations. 


## Running the crawler and cleaning the data

simply run ``` make run``` in your cli and the data will be scraped and then cleaned. At the end you should have two files, one containing the raw data and one containing the cleaned data.
